release 6.7.0
 - PSD added  pac_bio_run_name field to pac_bio_run table to support
   runs being created in traction as well as SequenceScape LIMs

   destination
 - iseq_run_lane_metrics table - added columns to store per-lane
   Illumina InterOp data

release 6.6.0
 - add instrument_external_name column to the iseq_run_lane_metrics
   table

release 6.5.0
 - more detailed comments for some columns.
 - 'annotation' column reduced to 15 chars since it's not free text
 - added columns for whole genome yield and end of phase2 analysis
   date
 - fixed spelling in one of the columns, ie changed column name
   from archive_conformation_date to archive_confirmation_date

release 6.4.0
 - iseq_external_product_component table redesign to allow for
   rows on iseq_product_metrics table to be deleted and recreated
   without making data in the linking table invalid
 - yield column in the iseq_external_product_component table changed
   from integer to float to correctly accommodate source data
 - code to creating rows in the iseq_external_product_component table,
   which will be run on row creation the and sometimes on row update
   for rows of the iseq_external_product_metrics table; this code will
   also be used to create a backlog of linking rows for existing
   iseq_external_product_metrics table rows

release 6.3.0
 - table update for iseq_external_product_metrics:
   drops id_iseq_pr_metrics_tmp and a foreign key based on it
     since maintenence will be difficult,
   adds index on id_iseq_product to enable using this column
     in joining to iseq_product_metrics table on a similar column,
   adds an indexed id_run column in case stats by run is needed
 - insert and update DBIx IseqExternalProductMetric class
   customisation to ensure that composition data and id_run
   columns are filled in

   table

release 5.0
 - added target autosome fields to iseq_product_metrics
 - added DBIx binding for the bmap_flowcell table for the
   BioNano Saphyr instrument

release 4.0
 - iseq_product_metrics table: make id_iseq_product column not nullable,
     set unique constraint on it
 - a new table iseq_product_components - linking table for product records
     in iseq_product_metrics

release 3.1
 - add column 'nrd_percent' for non-reference discordance to the
    'iseq_product_metrics' table

release 3.0
 - 'last_changed' columns added to both 'iseq_product_metrics' and
   'iseq_run_lane_metrics' tables
 - 'workflow_type' and 'instrument_side' columns added to the
   'iseq_run_lane_metrics' table
 - 'qc_seq' column addedto the 'iseq_run_lane_metrics' table
 - redundant 'iseq_pm_run_index' indexed dropped from 'iseq_product_metrics'
   table
 - changes to enable saving results for merged entities to'iseq_product_metrics':
     NOT NULL constraint dropped from 'id_run' and 'position' columns;
     nullable 'id_iseq_product' column added to save composition digest;
     nullable 'iseq_composition_tmp' added to save a short form of composition
     JSON, needed because we do not have the linking table yet

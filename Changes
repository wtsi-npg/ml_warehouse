LIST OF CHANGES
---------------

 - Updated DBIx classes to bring them up-to-date with the production database.

release 6.38.0 (2025-04-02)
 - Change iseq_product_metrics tag_decode_count from int to bigint to support
   values greater than 4294967295 and bring other tables up to date.
  
release 6.37.0 (2025-03-10)
 - Added 'lane_released' column to the existing iseq_run_lane_metrics table
   to capture the date of lane release.

release 6.36.0 (2025-02-20)
 - Added eseq_run table to ml warehouse database. The table will keep
   information about a run performed on an Element Biosciences instrument.
   Generate DBIx class for this table.

release 6.35.0 (2025-01-16)
 - Fix perlbrew installation by installing libdevel-patchperl-perl in
   GitHub runner.
 - Updated ORM classes by ingesting changes for the 'sample' table from the
   production database. Added a class for the 'aliqoute' table.

release 6.34.0 (2024-10-24)
 - Added new delegated methods to WTSI::DNAP::Warehouse::Schema::Result::IseqFlowcell,
   sample_uuid and sample_lims.
 - Updated ORM classes by ingesting changes from the prod database

release 6.33.1 (2024-10-04)
 - Added .github/dependabot.yml file to auto-update GitHub actions
 - GitHub CI - updated deprecated v2 runner action to v3
 - Following a release on 07/09/2024, see https://metacpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/changes,
   the checksum of the script served by https://install.perlbrew.pl had changed.
   https://install.perlbrew.pl is a redirect to raw
   https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/blob/master/perlbrew-install, so
   the change originates from GitHub and can be trusted. Our CI flow compares
   the checksum of the downloaded script to the expected value. We now store
   an updated expected checksum value, which corresponds to the latest release.

release 6.33.0 (2024-08-30)
 - Study class updated following the addition of the
   contaminated_human_data_access_group column to the study table.

   id for a sample well.

release 6.26.0
 - PacBio metrics tables:
     1. make product id columns not nullable since LangQC relies
        on these ids being available;
     2 set collation for product ids so that it is possible to easily join
       these tables to seq_product_irods_locations table.

release 6.25.0
 - Add columns to the pac_bio_run_well_metrics and pac_bio_product_metrics
   to store QC state for PacBio wells and products

   table

release 6.20.0
 - Add a table for storing one of Illumina's XML files with
   run information, iseq_run_info.
   Add columns to the iseq_run table to capture some values from
   these Illumina files. The choice of the values is driven by the
   current financial reporting need.
   Create a trigger to populate these columns when the record in
   the iseq_run_info is created or updated.
 - Bring DBIx classes up-to-date. 

release 6.19.2
 - additional fields for the pac_bio_run_well_metrics tables and
   bring DBIx classes up-to-date.

release 6.19.1
 - change collation on id_product row of seq_product_irods_locations to
   utf8_unicode_ci to enable JOINs

release 6.19.0
 - bring DBIx classes up-to-date with the prod. database

release 6.18.0
 - bring DBIx classes up-to-date with the prod. database
 - add product_irods table to provide irods paths for data
 - add columns to iseq_external_product_metrics for data deletion status

release 6.17.0
 - Improve record creation for iseq_external_product_metrics.
   Be able to handle complex file names, which explicitly list
   merged lanes, for example, 38421_1-2-4#30.cram. Be able to
   generate correct composition, product id and linking rows for
   such records.

release 6.16.0
 - add user requested control columns to the pac_bio_run_well_metrics
   table
 - Update Copyright statements for all Perl modules according to WSI
   requirements. Retrofit years using dates returned by 'git log' command.
   Example:
     git log -- SOME_MODULE.pm | grep 'Date:' | cut -d ':' -f 4 | \
     cut -d ' ' -f 2 | uniq | sort -g | xargs echo | \
     perl -nle '$_=~s/\ /,/g; print "Copyright (C) $_ Genome Research Ltd."'
 - DBIx classes updated and new classes added by running scripts/make_schema.pl
   against the production database. cherrypicked_sample view is excluded from
   the database inspection, DBIx does not like the definition. 
 - Add additional columns to the iseq_heron_product_metrics table to capture
   the pipeline's URL, ivar_md minimum depth value used with ivar and metrics
   for the consensus computed with an alternative ivar minimum depth ivar_amd.

release 6.15.0
 - Move from Travis CI to GitHub Actions.
 - If a WHERE clause in a SELECT query for the iseq_flowcell table
   specifies id_flowcell_lims, the query runs faster if the value
   is supplied as a string rather than an integer. If the value is
   supplied as an integer, the query cannot use the search index,
   resulting in a full table scan, during which the values in the
   id_flowcell_lims column are converted to doubles. Some of the
   values in the column are true strings which cannot be converted
   to doubles. Thousands of such values give thousands of warnings.
   To make queries more efficient, the id_flowcell_lims value
   in the WHERE part of the DBIx query is explicitly converted to
   strings. Clear difference can be seen when running the code
   with DBI_TRACE enabled.

     a direct join between the iseq_flowcell ad iseq_run_status tables;
